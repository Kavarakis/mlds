Machine Learning for Data Science

In this repository you can find detailed showcase and implementation from scratch of common supervised learning algorithm and techniques in python, done as part of Machine Learning for Data Science 1 course. They are coupled with .pdf reports, setup.md files which explain the task on hand and .py files with implementations.

- LogisticRegression ( Multinomial, Ordinal)
- Regularization (RidgeRegression, LassoRegression)
- Trees (CART, RandomForest)
- Kernels ( KernelizedRidgeRegression - RBF, Polynomial, Linear Kernel)
- Artificial Neural Network
- Loss Estimation ( Risk estimation, Holdout estimation,overestimation, split variability loss estimator, Cross - Validation)
